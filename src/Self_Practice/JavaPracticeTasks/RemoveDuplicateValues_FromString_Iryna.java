Java Practice Tasks:
1.Iryna
Write a return program that can remove the duplicate values from String Ex: ("AAABBBCCC") ==> ABC
2. Sana
Write a program that prints out the numbers from 1 to 30 but for numbers which are
a multiple of 3, print "FIN" instead of the number and for numbers which are a multiple
of 5, print "RA" instead of the number. For numbers which are a multiple of both 3 and 5,
print "FINRA" instead of the number.

Write a program that will count how many times “java” is found in any given String.
4. Nilufar
Given any String determine if it is Palindrome. Print “Palindrome” if it is and “Not Palindrome” if it is not:
5. Nurcan
Given any String print out how many times each character is found in the String
6. Margie
Write a program that can find the unique characters from the String Ex: ("AAABBBCCCDEF") ==> "DEF";
7. Vesela
Given two Strings determine if they are Anagrams -> Are built of the same characters:
8.Aziza
Create a program that will take any String and print each number from that string and  the total sum of all the numbers in that String.  Note: numbers can be more than digits from 1-9 so if you have “14” next to each other it should be considered 14 and not 1 and 4 separate: EX jav4a5i15sgre1at82
